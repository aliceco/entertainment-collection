        <p>Set in Madrid, a mysterious man known as "The Professor" recruits a group of eight people, who choose cities
          for code-names, to carry out an ambitious plan that involves entering the Royal Mint of Spain, and escaping
          with €2.4 billion. After taking 67 people hostage inside the Mint, the team plans to remain inside for 11 days
          to print the money as they deal with elite police forces. In the events succeeding the initial heist, the
          group are forced out of hiding and find themselves preparing for a second heist, this time on the Bank of
          Spain, as they again deal with hostages and police forces.</p>

        <p>A quick paced heist show which just sucks you in. The show follows a group of criminals who have decided to
          pull off a big heist (later two). There are many parts of the show I love. Its characters, the acting, the
          music and how they show of the complexity of the heist. The show is hilt in a way to makes you really care for
          each and every main character. They all have their own reasons to join the heist, they all have their own
          history. They all come together and form a bond which further strengthen the charm of the show. The show also
          balances the thrill and action of the heist with more calmer bits and character development.
          It’s a show definitely worth watching, and for goodness sake watch it in Spanish with subtitles, to fully be
          able to appreciate the acting.

        <p class="title">Review</p>
        <p>The best part of this show is Lucifer himself. Tom Ellis does such a great job portraying the narcissistic
          devil and brings the charm up an extra notch with his British accent. What the plot lacks, lucifers
          personality weighs up for. Personally I find the plot rather repetitive. Most episodes have a pretty clear
          formula it follows and although the show has a overarching plot it’s just not quite up there with some other
          shows. However it’s a good show if you want some good laughs, have a thing for narcissistic charming British
          people who occasionally sings, and just want some light to watch. </p>

        <p>While running from a drug deal gone bad, brilliant young college
          dropout Mike Ross slips into a job interview with one of New York
          City's best legal closers, Harvey Specter. Tired of cookie-cutter
          law-school grads, Harvey takes a gamble by hiring Mike on the spot
          after recognizing his raw talent and photographic memory. Mike and
          Harvey are a winning team. Although Mike is a genius, he still has a
          lot to learn about law; and while Harvey might seem like an
          emotionless, cold-blooded shark, Mike's sympathy and concern for
          their cases and clients will help remind Harvey why he went into law
          in the first place. Mike's other allies in the office include the
          firm's best paralegal Rachel and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant
          Donna. Proving to be an irrepressible duo and invaluable to the
          practice, Mike and Harvey must keep their secret from everyone
          including managing partner Jessica and Harvey's archnemesis Louis,
          who seems intent on making Mike's life as difficult as possible.</p>

        <p>An absolutely great show if you witty comebacks and sarcastic humour. Its early seasons move in a slightly
          quicker pace, dealing with the troubles that the law firm a counter and winning cases. Although the plot
          itself in the long term gets a bit boring my love for the show comes from its characters. Harvey Specter and
          Mike Ross is an iconic duo with way too much ego for the own good, but there’s something that makes you still
          like them. The rest of the cast have their own quirks that makes you invested in their stories even if they’re
          just a side character, and that’s the beauty of the show.
