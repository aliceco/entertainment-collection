            Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art
            of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the
            subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most
            vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in
            this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also
            made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has
            ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One
            last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish
            the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and
            his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is
            not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be
            the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise
            can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict
            their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming. - imdb

            It's the year 2044, and the real world has become an ugly place.
            We're out of oil. We've wrecked the climate. Famine, poverty, and
            disease are widespread. Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes
            this depressing reality by spending his waking hours jacked into the
            OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia where you can be anything you want
            to be, where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten
            thousand planets. And like most of humanity, Wade is obsessed by the
            ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this alternate
            reality: OASIS founder James Halliday, who dies with no heir, has
            promised that control of the OASIS - and his massive fortune - will
            go to the person who can solve the riddles he has left scattered
            throughout his creation. For years, millions have struggled
            fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that the riddles are
            based in the culture of the late twentieth century. And then Wade
            stumbles onto the key to the first puzzle. Suddenly, he finds
            himself pitted against thousands of competitors in a desperate race
            to claim the ultimate prize, a chase that soon takes on terrifying
            real-world dimensions - and that will leave both Wade and his world
            profoundly changed. - adlibris

            While running from a drug deal gone bad, brilliant young college
            dropout Mike Ross slips into a job interview with one of New York
            City's best legal closers, Harvey Specter. Tired of cookie-cutter
            law-school grads, Harvey takes a gamble by hiring Mike on the spot
            after recognizing his raw talent and photographic memory. Mike and
            Harvey are a winning team. Although Mike is a genius, he still has a
            lot to learn about law; and while Harvey might seem like an
            emotionless, cold-blooded shark, Mike's sympathy and concern for
            their cases and clients will help remind Harvey why he went into law
            in the first place. Mike's other allies in the office include the
            firm's best paralegal Rachel and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant
            Donna. Proving to be an irrepressible duo and invaluable to the
            practice, Mike and Harvey must keep their secret from everyone
            including managing partner Jessica and Harvey's archnemesis Louis,
            who seems intent on making Mike's life as difficult as possible.

            The album was described as a concept album about a "colourful" night
            at a party, as well as "the importance of escapism, hope and the
            preciousness of close friendships". The party was additionally
            described as having an atmosphere of "turbulent emotional chaos" and
            "euphoria, carelessness and a small dose of madness". Each song is
            set at a specific time during this night; these times were also
            revealed through the Doom Days Society website. - Wikipedia
